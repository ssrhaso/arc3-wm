# Recordings & Replays

> Viewing your agent's gameplay

Recordings let you view and share your agent's gameplay sessions.

## When Recordings Are Available

| Method            | Recordings Available                                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **API**           | Yes - viewable online via scorecard                           |
| **Swarm**         | Yes - saved locally and viewable online                       |
| **Local Toolkit** | No - running locally without API does not generate recordings |

## Online Replays

For games played via the API, you can view recordings online through your scorecard:

`https://arcprize.org/scorecards/<scorecard_id>`

Here is an example [recording](https://arcprize.org/replay/1d251d20-9043-4ace-9f9d-09822f5438d8).

## Local Recording Files

When running a [swarm](/swarms), agent gameplay is recorded by default and stored in the `recordings/` directory with GUID-based filenames:

```
ls20-6cbb1acf0530.random.100.a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890.recording.jsonl
```

The filename format is: `{game_id}.{agent_type}.{max_actions}.{guid}.recording.jsonl`

## Recording File Format

### JSONL Format

Recordings are stored in JSONL format with timestamped entries:

```json theme={null}
{"timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:45.123456+00:00", "data": {"game_id": "ls20-016295f7601e", "frame": [...], "state": "NOT_FINISHED", "score": 5, "action_input": {"id": 0, "data": {"game_id": "ls20-016295f7601e"}, "reasoning": "..."}, "guid": "...", "full_reset": false}}
{"timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:46.234567+00:00", "data": {"game_id": "ls20-016295f7601e", "frame": [...], "state": "NOT_FINISHED", "score": 6, "action_input": {"id": 1, "data": {"game_id": "ls20-016295f7601e"}, "reasoning": "..."}, "guid": "...", "full_reset": false}}
```
