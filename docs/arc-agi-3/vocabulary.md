## ARC-AGI-3

The third iteration of the ARC-AGI benchmark, featuring interactive game environments that test an AI agent's ability to explore, learn, and adapt in real-time.

## Arcade

The main entry point class in the ARC-AGI Toolkit (`arc_agi.Arcade()`). Handles configuration, environment discovery, and scorecard management.

## Environment

An interactive game instance that an agent can play. Each environment has a game state, available actions, and scoring. Created using `arc.make("game_id")`.

## Swarm

A system for orchestrating multiple agents across multiple games simultaneously. Swarms handle concurrent execution, scorecard management, and cleanup.

## Toolkit

The ARC-AGI Toolkit - an open-source Python SDK for interacting with ARC-AGI-3 environments locally or via API.
