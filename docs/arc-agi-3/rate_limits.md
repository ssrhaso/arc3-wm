# Rate Limits

> Limiting RPM for your agents

The ARC-AGI API is currently free to use during its research preview and is supported on a best-effort basis. We do not currently offer a formal SLA, uptime guarantee, or guaranteed response times. To prevent abuse and ensure fair access, we implement rate limits with an exponential backoff mechanism.

These limits help maintain system stability by throttling excessive requests. If you encounter rate limiting, your requests will receive a backoff response, requiring you to wait increasingly longer periods before retrying.

Rate limits are set at 600 requests per minute (RPM).

## Requesting Limit Increases

We are open to discussing increases in rate limits, particularly for researchers and teams requiring higher throughput.

If you need elevated limits, please email us at [team@arcprize.org](mailto:team@arcprize.org) with the subject line "Increase Rate Limits" to initiate a conversation.

## Navigating Rate Limits

If you've managed to hit a rate limit, you'll see a standard `429` response.

```json theme={null}
{"error":"RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED","message":"rate limit has been exceeded"}
```
