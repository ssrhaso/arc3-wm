# Local vs Online

> Playing games locally with the engine vs online via the API

Choose how you want to run ARC-AGI-3 games.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Local (Recommended)" icon="computer" href="#local">
    Fast, no rate limits, run many instances
  </Card>

  <Card title="Online" icon="cloud" href="#online">
    Scorecards, replays, requires API key
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Local

Run games locally using the ARC-AGI engine. This is the recommended approach for development and testing.

```python theme={null}
from arc_agi import Arcade, OperationMode

arc = Arcade(operation_mode=OperationMode.OFFLINE)
env = arc.make("ls20", render_mode="terminal")
```

| Advantages                              | Limitations          |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| \~2,000 FPS (120,000 frames per minute) | No online scorecards |
| No rate limits                          | No shareable replays |
| Run as many instances as you want       |                      |
| No API key required                     |                      |

## Online

Run games via the API to get scorecards and replays.

```python theme={null}
from arc_agi import Arcade, OperationMode

arc = Arcade(operation_mode=OperationMode.ONLINE)
env = arc.make("ls20", render_mode="terminal")
```

| Advantages                            | Limitations                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| View [scorecards](/scorecards) online | Requires [API key](/api-keys)                     |
| Shareable [replays](/recordings)      | Capped at [600 requests per minute](/rate_limits) |
| Results appear on leaderboard         |                                                   |
