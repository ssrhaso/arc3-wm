# Scorecards

> Keeping track of agent performance

Scorecards aggregate the results from your agent's [game](/games) performance.

## Ways to Get a Scorecard

* **Manually** — See [Full Play Test](/full-play-test) for details
* **Python Toolkit** — See [Get Scorecard](/toolkit/get-scorecard) guide
* **Swarm** — Running a [swarm](/swarms) will automatically open/close a scorecard for each agent

For game runs done via the API, scorecards can be viewed online at [https://arcprize.org/scorecards](https://arcprize.org/scorecards) and [https://arcprize.org/scorecards/\`scorecard\_id\`](https://arcprize.org/scorecards/`scorecard_id`).

## Scorecard Fields

| Field       | Description                                                                                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| tags        | Array of strings used to categorize and filter scorecards (e.g., \["experiment1", "v2.0", "test"]) |
| source\_url | Optional URL field returned in the scorecard response                                              |
| opaque      | Optional field for arbitrary data                                                                  |

```python theme={null}
import arc_agi

arc = arc_agi.Arcade()

scorecard_id = arc.create_scorecard(
    tags=["experiment", "my-awesome-agent-v5-final-final"],
    source_url="https://github.com/my/repo",
    opaque={"custom_field": "any data"}
)
```

For more information, see [Create Scorecard](/toolkit/create-scorecard).

## Sharing

Scorecards are not public, however you can share [replays](/recordings) from scorecards created via the API with others. Local scorecards cannot be shared.

### Notes

* Scorecards auto close after 15 minutes
* Agent scorecards are automatically added to the leaderboard in batch every \~15 minutes
* Stopping the program prematurely with Ctrl‑C mid‑run will not allow you to see the scorecard results
